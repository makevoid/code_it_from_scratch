h1. Coding it from scratch!

---


- when you are starting to code something, the less you have the better!
- library you require and their dependencies are code that you don't control directly
  - it can be complex
  - can have bugs
  - can slow your app down 
  
---


Did you...

- wait for minutes for a test suite to finish
- discovered a feature you need in library "x" is not implemented
- hit bugs in the library x and realized it's gazillion lines of long messy code?
- spent more time in searching documentation than 

so...

Don't &#9995;

```bash
$ rails new myapp
```

---

/ prefer something more like 

h2. sinatra

---

> don't do this:

and even in sinatra:

&#9995;

```ruby
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base

end
```

> the moment you do that your code is not small anymore!


---

- start from sinatra 

- transition into rails if you need

( you can always mount a rack app [like sinatra] 
in the rails router - so SOA! )

> service oriented architecture


---

```ruby
class Post
  # uuh... plain ruby
end
```


---

```ruby
class Post
  # can't you hear the sound of freedom?
end
```

---

...

> ok, what I'm going to show you it's really basic, but bare with me


---



```ruby
class Post
  attr_accessor :title
  attr_accessor :content
  
  def initialize(attrs={})
    @title    = attrs[:title]
    @content  = attrs[:content]
  end
end
```

---

```ruby
post = Post.new( title: "ruby", 
  content: "when it's plain, it's powerful" )
post.title #=> "ruby"
```

> this may seem too basic, but believe me, it's convenient!

> and you can easily go beyond that!

> NEXT: for a model library:

---

datas == array of hashes

---

```bash
people = [person1, person2]
```

---

```bash
people = [{ #person1
          }, 
          { #person2
          }] 
```

--- 

in ruby:

```ruby
[
  { name: "mario", age: 28 }, 
  { name: "luigi", age: 32 },
  # ...   
]
```

--- 

or in json (.to_json is your friend):

```javascript
[
  { "name": "mario", "age": 28 }, 
  { "name": "luigi", "age": 32 }
  // ...
]
```

---

you can use eval (it's evil only in production, in development can be time saving)

```ruby
def load_posts(user_id)
  { # ... }
end

[
  { id: 1, name: "mario", age: 28, 
    posts: load_posts(1) 
  }
].sort_by{ #... }
```

when developing, write your data in a file, so you don't need to query a database, you can just open that file


---

load them into objects

```ruby
@posts = posts.map do |post|
  Post.new( title: post.title, 
  content: post.content )
end
```
  
  
--- 

when developing

do you really need persistence?


> when developing, do you really need persistence? most of the time not! you need datas that persist in memory

h3. data is code, code is data

data > write to file

```ruby
objects = [{ }, { }]

File.open("./db/data.rb", "w") do |f|
  f.write objects
end
```

> your collection of objects can be easily wrote to file

---

read file > eval contents > data!


```ruby
objects = File.read "./db/data.rb"

puts objects #=> [{}, {}]
```

> ..and you can simply retrieve them with an eval (of course you can use yaml/json/redis/pstore if you prefer)

---


you can dynamically load datas and modify your objects
   

*attr_accessor* 

*instance_variable_set* 

are your friends!

---

choice:

]]]]]] SKIP TO CODE RELOADING

]]]]]] CONTINUE WITH RUBY EXAMPLES

]] blizz follows


---

```ruby
# for every key in your hash
key = :antani
val = "sblinda"
instance_variable_set "@#{key}", val

# and to access them easily
attr_accessor key
# (need to do it at class level)
```

---


```ruby
# how to get to class level?

def self.included(mod)
  mod.send :extend, ClassMethods
end

module ClassMethods
  def create_accessors(hash)
    attr_accessor *hash.keys
  end
end
```

---

without method missing
without instance/class eval

those are cool but not very clear to debug, isn't it?

---

```ruby
class Page

  def self.load(hash)
    page = Page.new
    page.load hash
    page
  end

  def load(hash)
    Page.create_accessors hash
    load_contents hash
  end

  private

  def load_contents(hash)
    hash.map do |key, val|
      instance_variable_set "@#{key}", val
    end
  end
  
end
```

---

available as a gem: "github/makevoid/blizz":https://github.com/makevoid/blizz

but as the code it's simple, I suggest coding it yourself personalizing it :) 

---


then of course you can use it


```ruby
hash = { title: "test", contents: "bla" }
page = Page.load hash

# accessors are created for you
page.title #=> "test"
page.contents #=> "bla"
```    
    
---    
    
> test
    
with nested embedded objects:

```ruby
post_hash = { 
  title: "test", 
  comments: ["bla", "asd", "lol"] 
}
```
    
(simple)

---

more complex:

```ruby
post_hash = { 
  title: "test", 
  comments: [
    { id: 1, text: "bla", user_id: 1 },
    { id: 2, text: "asd", user_id: 2 },
    { id: 3, text: "lol", user_id: 1 },
    #...
  ]
}
```


go crazy and find your own way!

---

then you want to use activerecord? easy, your external api looks already like that!

  
---
  
  
or use ActiveModel?
or "YAML::Store":http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0/libdoc/yaml/rdoc/YAML/Store.html / "PStore":http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0/libdoc/pstore/rdoc/PStore.html (both in stdlib),
"Virtus":https://github.com/solnic/virtus (made for "DataMapper2, now ROM":http://rom-rb.org/),
or "ActiveRecord without Rails":http://blog.aizatto.com/2007/05/21/activerecord-without-rails/,
or "DataMapper":http://datamapper.org (v1)


> next: autoload 


---

when you don't have rails

you don't have autoload / autoreload

---

the fact is you don't need autoload

simply use require + Dir.glob

```ruby
def require_all(dir)
  Dir.glob("#{dir}/*.rb").each do |file|
    require file
  end
end

require_all "models"
```

---

then in your models, if some model requires another you have to manually require them


```ruby
require_relative "a"

model B
  def foo
    A.bar
  end
end
```


---

autoreload

ctrl+C + up arrow + enter &#x1F600;

rerun [link]

guard-reload [link]

> if your [dev env/setup] is slow, you are developing at turtle speed &#x1F422;

h2. models / DDD


> ruby part:

> models: stated before



---

there are a lot of functions in stdlib, use them!

---


h4. cuuuustooooom foooormaaats!!!


- Textile/Markdown + extensions 

[like github flavored markdown, they're just pre/post parsers] 


_my 2 cents:_

- "SAF - Simple Articles Format":https://github.com/makevoid/saf

---

textile/markdown are meant to be used in static, easily editable files

many blogging engines like jekyll or static sites generator use markdown/textile

if you are building a cms or you let user input some content prefer those over WYSIWIG editors (like TinyMCE)

---

```html
[image_ID] -> <img src="./path/to/imgs/ID.png" />
[audio_ID] -> <audio src="./path/to/audios/ID.mp3"></audio>

[youtube_ID] -> <object>youtube embed ID...</object>
[vimeo_ID] -> <object>vimeo embed ID...</object>

[....] -> 
```

simple regexes

```ruby
/\[youtube_(.+)\]/

/\[image_(\d+)\]/
```

use ruby match / gsub

---


h1. Env file

think about having an env file

---


h4. Env file

] put in it all your dependencies and models requirements

*env.rb* - ex. with bundler:

```ruby
require 'bundler/setup'
Bundler.require :default

# require your models

# load seeds here
# and/or connect to your db(s)
```


---

so in your *app.rb* you can do:

```ruby
require './env'
```

and have your gems, models, etc. loaded

---

h4. plus

that way you can do:

```bash
irb -r ./env.rb
```

and have your environment loaded (like rails console)


---

```bash
$ irb -r ./env.rb
> 
```

---

```bash
$ irb -r ./env.rb
> Model.all #=> [{...}, {...}] 
```

---

h3. How to require

look at different requiring mechanisms

```ruby
require "file" # standard for gems
require "./file" 
require_relative "file"
```

otherwise:
append to *$LOAD_PATH*
_(I don't suggest this approach)_


---

my favourite:

```ruby
path = File.expand_path "../", __FILE__
require "#{path}/file"
```

---

main app class:

```ruby
class App
  @@path = File.expand_path "../", __FILE__
  
  def self.path
    @@path
  end
end
```

then you can call *App.path* like *Rails.root*

_(where there's "../" you will put your root project dir level)_

---

example: 

```bash
app dir /
  |
  -- app.rb
  -- ..
```

the path will be "../"

---

```bash
app dir /
  |
  -- lib/
      |
      -- app.rb
      -- ..
  -- ..
```

the path will be "../../", etc...


next....

h1. HTML / CSS (& Sass)

CSS resets


---

h1. HTML / CSS (& Sass)

CSS resets

don't use Compass or HTML5 boilerplates 

reset what you care about!

---

h1. HTML / CSS (& Sass)

CSS resets

don't use Compass or HTML5 boilerplates 

reset what you care about!

"Compass":http://compass-style.org/ > "Bourbon":http://bourbon.io/ > *custom mixins*

> if you use *Compass* drop to *Bourbon* then drop to custom mixins 

finalize when you have to ship it, don't overoptimize prematurely!

---

my favourite css reset:

```css
// right, just that

body {
  margin: 0;
}
```

---

// and if you use links

```css
a {
  text-decoration: none
}
```

---

```css
// support IE

img {
  border: 0
}
```

---

&#x1F44D;

do layouts by yourself

don't use css frameworks / grid systems / boilerplates

---

use *box-sizing* for layouts

```css
box-sizing: border-box
```

it allows you to think about the content width without too many calculations
you can mix fluid (%/em) widths and fixed paddings (in px) 

_your playground it's always ready!_

---

```html
// index.html

<style>
  div {
    box-sizing: border-box
  }
</style>

<div>this is a valid html page</div>
```

> of course later you may want to add html and body tags

---

box-sizing example:

```html
<style>
  body {
    margin: 0;
  }

  div {
    box-sizing: border-box;
    float: left;
    width: 50%;
    padding: 20px;
    background: lightGrey; // to show them
  }
</style>

<div>a div</div>
<div>another div</div>
```

---

without horizontal padding

<div class="layout_example1">a div</div>
<div class="layout_example1">another div</div>

---

with a bit of padding

<div class="layout_example2">a div</div>
<div class="layout_example2">another div</div>

---

more padding, width remains 50%

<div class="layout_example3">a div</div>
<div class="layout_example3">another div</div>

---

note: needs to be prefixed in FF

```javascript
-moz-box-sizing: border-box;
```

works only in IE8+


---

h2. Sass, hands on:

_(less is very similar though)_

> you can use Sass to write prefixed css


---


use Sass/Less/etc variables and operations:

for layout:

```sass
# Sass example

$main: 80%
$side: 2%
$rest: $main - $side*2
```

---

create more complex layout system using variables:


use color operations to create themes!

```css
body
  color: #C00       // red
  background: #EEE  // light grey 
```

---

extract the colors you use into variables

```css
$main_color: #C00
$bg_color: #EEE

body
  color: $main_color
  background: $bg_color
```

---



```css
$main_color: #C00
$bg_color: #EEE

body
  background: $bg_color
```

---

```css
a
  color: $main_color
a:hover
  color: $main_color + #222 
  // makes the links brigher on hover
  
.content
  background: $bg_color - #222 
  // makes it darker
```

---


```css
$main_color: #0A0  // green
$bg_color: #EFE    // light green
```

> and if you change the variables, you change the colors! here's your theme generator

---

there are many more color functions like

```css
darken()
lighten()
adjust_hue()
colorize()
grayscale()
alpha()
...
```

"more":http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/Sass/Script/Functions.html


---

Ruby developers
focus a lot on backends
focus less on frontend 

[we forget that html/css is also programming, especially when css preprocessors are involved]

---

Do it yourself, you'll save time in the end:

- Sinatra over Rails
- Sass over Compass
- plain JS over JQuery and plugins

If you code something, from the ground up, you are sure that you do it based on what you need.

But! It will take more time, sure :D

---

h1. JS

build your own:
  - click events
  - image gallery
  - autocomplete
  - infinite page scrolling
  - manage history state (push/pop)State yourself
  - please don't use pjax / fast-rails-hack-ajax-speed-reload-antani?
    - do ajax call yourself, use history api, so you can use it for the content part

---

click event example:

```javascript
// with jquery/zepto

$("a.clickable").on("click", function(evt){
  console.log("clicked")
  evt.preventDefault()
})
```

---

```javascript
// that becomes:

var link = $("a.clickable")
link.on("click", function(evt){
  console.log("clicked")
  evt.preventDefault()
})
```

---

```javascript
// and finally:

var link = $("a.clickable")
var handle_click = function(evt){
  console.log("clicked")
  evt.preventDefault()
}
link.on("click", handle_click)
```

---

```javascript
// plain js

var link = document.querySelector("a.clickable")
var handle_click = function(evt){
  console.log("clicked")
  evt.preventDefault()
}
link.addEventListener("onclick", handle_click)
```

not that hard isn't it?

---


querySelector

```javascript
img = document.querySelector("img.antani")

Q = document.querySelector
( QA = document.querySelectorAll )
$ = document.querySelector
```

---

```javascript
img = $("img.antani")
img = Q("img.antani") 
```

tip: use specific tags in your js (especially if a specific tag like an img/audio/video/section/span/caption...)


otherwise you always have to do get(0) to get to the real element


---


data attributes

```javascript
// jquery
img.data("id")
```

---

```javascript
// wouldn't be better if it was
img.data.id  // ?
```

---

```javascript
// well in js is really like this
img.dataSet.id
```

> hmmm :D


---

also for classes (*addClass/removeClass*)

and for appending/prepending to the dom:
*innerHTML += / insertBefore / appendElement*

> // prototyping // dealing with change // "lean" // "agile" // insert buzzword here! // from a fucking blank editor!  you know?  


"see other examples":http://www.leebrimelow.com/native-methods-jquery/


---

h4. make your code easy to read


---

h4. make your code easy to read 

(in the frontend world) 
this means also: 

h4. make your html/css easy to read

if it's small and modular, it will be easier


---

prefer:

- rails router over controllers
 - sinatra over rails
  - mount rack apps directly on router
 - catchall controller
 - api controller / no need for full ActionController (yeah, more metal &#127928; &#9835; , more speed)

---

- APIs
 
--- 
 
- view
  - pagination
  - form helpers (basic version is easy, validation integration can be tricky, especially with i18n)
  - link helpers
  - meta tags
  - js/css includes
  - HAML/Slim
  -- partials over view helpers

---
  
- workflow automation (guard)
  - compiling ( sass/less -> css,  coffee -> js )
  - browser reloading
  - concatenating
  - minifying
  (sprockets is slow isn't it? use guard [show guard-concat code])
  
---


use guard
to automate your workflow / coding sessions

[all guards available list] (github search)

guard-coffeescript
guard-sass
guard-livereload (+ browser plugin)
guard-concat
guard-reload
  
---  
  
- testing
  - test model in isolation, require only what you need (multiple spec helpers)
  - sinatra over rails (blazing fast integration testing)
  - custom/in memory/redis/datamapper/sequel over activerecord

---


for sites / clientside apps

start with an empty index.html

open it in your browser

when you need to host it use something like

```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000
```

---

then maybe move to sinatra 

then maybe move to rails (the total code weight will increase drastically in this phase &#x1F600; )

> it starts a server that hosts your static files

--- 

then tear down some defaults 

(you usually don't need all actioncontroller 

also see these "single file":http://rkistner.github.io/ruby/2013/05/03/single-file-rails/ "rails app":https://gist.github.com/josevalim/1942658 and one file rails app and this talk by "Jose Valim":http://www.confreaks.com/videos/2442-railsconf2013-you-ve-got-a-sinatra-on-your-rails  )

---

when choosing a library

some things are important:

size (number of lines) 
code quality
test coverage
require time (something that most people ignore, this impacts both development and testing time)

---

I've gone / I'm pushing it  to the extreme just to see when it's useful and when it's not

see where is your limit

try to go beyond that and to see if you benefit from it


to see wich library/technology to try and how to try it

search the library author name
find a talk about his library

---

h1. CIY (Code it Yourself)

---

h1. CIY

like DIY for things, if it's cheaper
in the end you will learn something new
or if you already know those things (let's say you need a pagination library) you can do it for exercise
to try a new TDD/BDD/etc way of coding
to train yourself

---

[warning: I'm not saying that you should rebuild EVERYTHING, that could be "a little" time consuming :)]
so don't rebuild rails if you need every part of it

---

instead, if you code something, and you see it's [simpler / solves the problem better / it has a feature that other libs don't / has a better api]
release that code as a library

- reuse it in other projects
- let other people use it, open source it
-- if people ask for features
-- tell people to fork it and implement those themselves


---

i'm not saying it's easy, especially with a big and "already running in production" project, but! you surely have another 

so, before you add x^n dependencies, consider to code it from a blank environment



---


coding from scratch keep your programmer memory fresh

less cut n paste

you need to produce:
- more modular code
- more targeted code

---


write method names you are going to implement BEFORE implementing them

---


don't block impelementing a method and then using it
---
start from outside the onion
---
>> it's seems fucking stupid but think about it


---

reach the MVP (minimal viable product)
MVD (minimal viable demo)
then iterate on that

> say that to those LEAN guys

---

prefer small iterations over big upfront overstructured designs

follow the "flow"
