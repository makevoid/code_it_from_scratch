h1. _

*underscore.js* is very cool because it adds to js a lot of useful functions that make it more like ruby!

*Array* [Enumberables] (each, map, count, sum ...)
String (...)
Function (throttle, once...)



BUT: dont use it like shown in the examples :D

---

```javascript
_([array]).map, function(){
  // ...
})
```

not

```javascript
_.map([array], function(){
  // ...  
})
```

:)

because so you can refactor as

```javascript
var array = _([array])
```

---

and you can do

```javascript
array.map(function(){
  // ...
})
```

---

and you can do

```javascript
array.map(function(elem, idx){
  // ...
})
```

---

and you can do

```javascript
array.map(function(elem, idx){
  // ...
})
```

it feels more like ruby!

a complete area of your brain makes analysis, your prefrontal cortex, then you have a creative part, located on the back sides of your head  

there is a cost in switching between analytic and creative (intuition) mode, you should should maximize the two phases, I think

so, again, code it from the fucking scratch


---   
  
in JS don't use ; they are optional! 

except when you use the wrapping namespace:

```javascript
(function(){ });
```

make JS easier to read/write

if you really have to, use zepto instead of jquery - if you don't plan to support IE8, especially on mobile devices

a bit basic


h1. ruby



use net http from scratch
[example]

```ruby
example = Net::HTTP.get_response "http://example.com"
puts example #=> "example!"
```

> CAN SKIP THIS

> always run it and see the output!

---

```ruby
def get_example
  Net::HTTP.get_response "http://example.com"
end

get_example()
```

---


in a class:


```ruby
class Antani
  # long list of methods

  def get_example
    Net::HTTP.get_response "http://example.com"
  end

  def parse_example
    example = get_example
    example.gsub(/example/, 'EXAMPLE') 
  end
end
```


---

or:

```ruby
class Antani
  # long list of methods

  def get_example
    @example = Net::HTTP.get_response "http://example.com"
  end

  def parse_example
     @example.gsub(/example/, 'EXAMPLE') 
  end
end
```

---

```ruby
class Antani

  include Example


module Example

  def get_example
    # ...

  def parse example
    # ....
```

(pseudo code)

a bit basic ENDS

[parallel but not the best fit]
fits more on a talk on: bootstrap your own product

gaming: Ultima Online, you start naked, no money

you have to eat or you'll die

can cultivate plants/ hunt for food

can beg money
can craft weapons / armors
mine rocks
cultivate plants
harvest wood
woodcraft
make fences and houses
hunt
fight


npcs / monsters / other players





lesson: you can create things based on your skills and make a living out of it

self: you can't spend anything, you can't

example:

rubyJS vs opalrb (sorry xxx)

not compiled - see video: http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/33526011

21kb gzipped

very precise mad man (not just the average programmer)

---

machine setup: (for your next machine / test deviece / designer machine / coworker ones [especially for remote coworkers])

should be fast
scripted / you have notes / you remember it well

don't use remote machines or vms to check (these are ok for production), this (at least in the cases i saw) slows down your development process

---

// so again, do it from scratch people!!



// especially if it's your boss paying for your code time!

// use the fucking time to learn! and not to learn to use a library well, but to build something simple and useful where it's needed

// i'm not saying NO to every libs, I just say

// think about it.... this part is better coded from scratch!!

---


As long as you work for a client / company, your first target after delivering stuff should be of improving yourself


You should build a site/app
  that you love
  that you need
  that you use

so the testing and improving phase is free! :D

---

fast development feedback loop


Don't use VMs

build a script that setups the environment


don't use chef
a sh script is better for starting

there's really not a good default for everything 
your custom configs can be better
an sh/ruby script is easier to edit that anything else
(if you structure it well)

---


for sysadmin i suggested the sh way to some programmer friends, i showed them a bit of setup code and told them to share their, and it worked very well
