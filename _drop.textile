example:

rubyJS vs opalrb (sorry xxx)

not compiled - see video: http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/33526011

21kb gzipped

very precise mad man (not just the average programmer)

machine setup: (for your next machine / test deviece / designer machine / coworker ones [especially for remote coworkers])

should be fast
scripted / you have notes / you remember it well

don't use remote machines or vms to check (these are ok for production), this (at least in the cases i saw) slows down your development process

// so again, do it from scratch people!!



// especially if it's your boss paying for your code time!

// use the fucking time to learn! and not to learn to use a library well, but to build something simple and useful where it's needed

// i'm not saying NO to every libs, I just say

// think about it.... this part is better coded from scratch!!

As long as you work for a client / company, your first target after delivering stuff should be of improving yourself


You should build a site/app
  that you love
  that you need
  that you use

so the testing and improving phase is free! :D

fast development feedback loop


Don't use VMs

build a script that setups the environment


don't use chef
a sh script is better for starting

there's really not a good default for everything 
your custom configs can be better
an sh/ruby script is easier to edit that anything else
(if you structure it well)

for sysadmin i suggested the sh way to some programmer friends, i showed them a bit of setup code and told them to share their, and it worked very well
