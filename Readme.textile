This presentation tool is coded from scratch :D

The whole presentation is in textile (slides.textile) with some additions like code highlghting.

It's a sinatra app, you can run it with:

    rackup -p 3000
    
the presentation will be active at: <http://localhost:3000>    
    
and you have a presenter view (buttons) if you go to <http://localhost:3000/presenter>

feel free to 
- fork the repo 
- clean slides.txt and pulic/main.css

and roll your own presentation!
